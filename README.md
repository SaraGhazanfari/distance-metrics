# distance-metrics

In this project, we try to calculate the distances in terms of Linf, L2, LPIPS and R-LPIPS (which is a robust version of LPIPS)
between train dataset of three datasets: CIFAR-10, SVHN, Tiny-Imagenet.

After cloning the requirements should be installed. And calculations can be done as mentioned below:

1- Calculate LPIPS for cifar10: python3 cifar10/cifar_lpips_distance.py

2- Calculate R-LPIPS for cifar10: python3 cifar10/cifar_r_lpips_distance.py

3- Calculate LPIPS for svhn: python3 svhn/svhn_lpips_distance.py

4- Calculate R-LPIPS for svhn: python3 svhn/svhn_r_lpips_distance.py

5- Calculate LPIPS for tiny-imagenet: python3 tiny-imagenet/tiny_imagenet_lpips_distance.py

6- Calculate R-LPIPS for tiny-imagenet: python3 tiny-imagenet/tiny_imagenet_r_lpips_distance.py
